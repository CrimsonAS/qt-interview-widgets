what is this
============

/** AWidgetListView is a list view, powered by Qt's Interview framework.
  * Unlike a traditional listview, it allows for full, easy customisation of the UI, by presenting items
  * as regular widgets, which may be created through Qt Designer or other means.
  */

Basically, it's like QWidget and QAbstractItemDelegate eloped, made sweet, sweet love, and had a lovechild.

You create an AWidget subclass, and an AWidgetListView instance, passing the AWidgetListView the staticMetaObject of your widget subclass.

Then, you set a model on the listview, and watch in amazement as AWidgetListView creates widgets for your model.

This allows for rich UI, done easily - no manual painting like delegates, meaning more robust, flexible, and easy to maintain code.
