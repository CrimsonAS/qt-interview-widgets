  * It represents the base class of all widgets that may be inserted into an QtWidgetListView.
  *
  * A QtModelWidget is sort of like QWidget and QAbstractItemDelegate eloped, made sweet, sweet love,
  * and had a baby.
  *
  * The difference with QtModelWidget and a delegate is you probably won't be doing the painting yourself:
  * you'll just be altering 'building block' widgets you put on your UI with Designer or something.
  *
  * Things to remember when writing a QtModelWidget subclass:
  *   * You must implement dataChanged().
  *     dataChanged() is automatically invoked when the data for your QModelIndex is changed,
  *     and as such, you need to update your UI as appropriate (and, if you're doing custom painting,
  *     remember to call QWidget::update())
  *   * You must have a constructor with the same signal as QtModelWidget's constructor, that
  *     invokes QtModelWidget's constructor.
  *   * You must mark your constructor Q_INVOKABLE!
  *
  * These are non-negotiable. It's just how the system works.
